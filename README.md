# Warp + v0.dev Hybrid Development System Prompt

A comprehensive system prompt that brings v0.dev's exceptional UI/UX standards and code generation capabilities to Warp's powerful terminal environment for local development.

## Overview

This prompt transforms Warp's AI Agent Mode into a development powerhouse that generates production-ready code with v0.dev's quality standards while leveraging the full power of terminal-based local development. It combines the best of both worlds: beautiful, accessible web applications with efficient command-line workflows.

## Key Features

### ðŸŽ¨ v0.dev Quality Standards
- **Production-ready code generation** - No placeholders, no TODOs, only complete implementations
- **Modern tech stack** - Next.js 15, React 18, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, shadcn/ui
- **Professional design system** - Strict color palettes (3-5 colors max), typography rules (2 fonts max), mobile-first responsive design
- **Accessibility first** - WCAG AA compliance, semantic HTML, proper ARIA attributes
- **Performance optimized** - Image optimization, code splitting, efficient re-renders

### ðŸš€ Enhanced Development Workflow
- **Automated Git commits** - Frequent commits with conventional commit messages
- **Smart server management** - Auto-restart on crashes, port conflict resolution, continuous error monitoring
- **Hot-reload with logging** - Development server runs in background with real-time error detection
- **Docker awareness** - Intelligent recommendations for containerized vs. local development
- **One-command deployment** - Deploy to Vercel with phrases like "publish it live"

### ðŸ’° Third-Party API Intelligence
- **Automatic pricing research** - Real-time cost lookups for external services
- **Setup guidance** - Direct links to sign-up pages and API key dashboards
- **Cost optimization** - Recommendations for free tiers and usage monitoring
- **Secure credential management** - Automatic `.env.local` setup with proper gitignore

### ðŸ“Š Continuous Monitoring
- **Server health checks** - Automatic detection and recovery from crashes
- **Error log analysis** - Real-time parsing of npm logs for issues
- **Build verification** - TypeScript compilation and build checks before deployment
- **Performance tracking** - Monitor for memory leaks and performance degradation

## Installation

1. Copy the system prompt to your Warp configuration
2. Enable Agent Mode in Warp
3. Start developing with v0.dev quality standards locally

## Usage Examples

### Create a new Next.js project with v0.dev standards:
```
"Set up a new Next.js project with TypeScript, Tailwind, and shadcn/ui"
```

### Build a complete feature:
```
"Create a responsive dashboard with charts and data tables"
```

### Deploy to production:
```
"Publish it live" or "Deploy this to Vercel"
```

### Integrate third-party services:
```
"Add Stripe payment processing to the checkout flow"
```
(Automatically provides pricing, setup instructions, and secure configuration)

## What Makes This Different

Unlike standard terminal AI assistants, this prompt:

1. **Generates complete, beautiful UI components** - Not just CLI commands
2. **Maintains design consistency** - Enforces v0.dev's strict design guidelines
3. **Automates the mundane** - Git commits, server restarts, error monitoring
4. **Thinks about costs** - Researches and reports API pricing before implementation
5. **Ships production-ready code** - No shortcuts, no placeholders, no technical debt

## Workflow Automation

The prompt includes several automated workflows:

- **Development server lifecycle** - Start, monitor, restart on failure
- **Git workflow** - Commit after each meaningful change with clear messages
- **Deployment pipeline** - Build, test, and deploy with single commands
- **Error recovery** - Automatic detection and resolution of common issues

## Supported Technologies

- **Frameworks**: Next.js 15+, React 18+, TypeScript
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS v4, shadcn/ui, CSS Modules
- **Testing**: Jest, React Testing Library, Playwright
- **Databases**: Supabase, Neon, PostgreSQL
- **APIs**: OpenAI, Stripe, SendGrid, Cloudinary
- **Deployment**: Vercel, Docker

## Best Practices Enforced

- âœ… Complete code only - no partial snippets
- âœ… TypeScript for everything
- âœ… Mobile-first responsive design
- âœ… Accessibility standards (WCAG AA)
- âœ… Consistent design tokens
- âœ… Proper error handling
- âœ… Secure environment variables
- âœ… Conventional commits
